# Project Plan for Web App (Project and Task Management)


## 1. Initial Planning and Research
**Milestone:** **Finalize project scope and objectives**
- Review and validate PRD.
- Define business goals, success metrics, and key performance indicators (KPIs).
- Identify target audience and create user personas.
- Define core features and prioritize them based on value and complexity.

## 2. Technical Design and Architecture
**Milestone:** **Create the technical design and system architecture**
- Decide on the overall system architecture (monolithic, microservices, serverless, etc.).
- Identify key components and how they will interact (e.g., front-end, back-end, database, APIs).
- Define tech stack (programming languages, frameworks, libraries).
- Design the architecture for scalability, security, and performance.
- Develop flow diagrams for user interactions and system components.

## 3. Database Design
**Milestone:** **Create database schema and structure**
- Identify key data entities (e.g., users, tasks, projects).
- Design database schema (tables, relationships, constraints).
- Choose the type of database (relational, NoSQL, etc.) based on project needs.
- Define necessary indices, queries, and data normalization strategies.

## 4. Development Environment Setup
**Milestone:** **Identify and set up the development environment**
- Choose development tools and IDEs (Integrated Development Environments).
- Set up version control (e.g., Git, GitHub, GitLab).
- Define coding standards, branching strategy, and commit guidelines.
- Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing, builds, and deployments.
- Decide on project management and issue-tracking tools (e.g., Jira, Trello).

## 5. Hosting and Deployment Strategy
**Milestone:** **Identify the hosting environment and deployment strategy**
- Choose hosting platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, Heroku, DigitalOcean).
- Set up staging and production environments.
- Define deployment pipeline for both back-end and front-end code.
- Ensure redundancy, load balancing, and disaster recovery processes.

## 6. Front-End & Back-End Design
**Milestone:** **Design the user interface and user experience (UI/UX)**
- Create wireframes and mockups for the web app (use tools like Figma, Adobe XD).
- Validate user flows with stakeholders and test with target users.
- Define navigation, page layout, and responsiveness for different devices.

**Milestone:** **Define API specifications and back-end services**
- Design RESTful API endpoints or GraphQL structure.
- Define authentication, authorization, and security mechanisms (OAuth, JWT).
- Plan for data validation, error handling, and API versioning.

## 7. Identify Key Milestones for Front-End and Back-End Development
**Milestone:** **Define front-end and back-end sprints or work breakdown structure**
- Break down core features into user stories and tasks.
- Prioritize MVP (Minimum Viable Product) features.
- Estimate development effort for front-end and back-end teams.
- Plan the sprint cycles and allocate resources.

## 8. Test Plan Creation
**Milestone:** **Create a test plan and define quality assurance procedures**
- Define test strategy: unit testing, integration testing, UI testing, and end-to-end testing.
- Select testing frameworks and tools (e.g., Jest, Mocha, Selenium).
- Identify performance testing and load testing tools (e.g., Apache JMeter, LoadRunner).
- Establish bug tracking and resolution procedures.

## 9. Marketing and User Acquisition Planning
**Milestone:** **Develop marketing and growth strategies**
- Identify user acquisition strategies (e.g., content marketing, SEO, social media).
- Develop a go-to-market strategy.
- Prepare product documentation, support, and help resources.
- Set up an email marketing system and onboarding processes for early adopters.

## 10. Final Review and Readiness Check
**Milestone:** **Conduct a final review and readiness check**
- Confirm all requirements are met and scope is clear.
- Finalize technical documentation and project roadmaps.
- Ensure team alignment on deadlines, deliverables, and responsibilities.
- Prepare for alpha or beta testing.
