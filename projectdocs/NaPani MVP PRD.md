# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project and Task Management App

### Overview & Competitive Differentiation

The Project and Task Management App is a streamlined platform designed for individuals and teams to manage projects efficiently without feature overload. Unlike complex enterprise tools, this product focuses on simplicity, ease of use, and essential collaboration features. It enables users to track tasks, assign responsibilities, and monitor progress without requiring extensive setup or training.

#### Key Differentiators:

- **Minimalist UI & UX** – Ensures a frictionless experience for users to manage tasks and projects quickly.
- **No Feature Bloat** – Provides only essential task management functionalities to avoid overwhelming users.
- **Fast & Responsive** – Designed for speed and efficiency with lightweight interactions.
- **Scalable for Small Teams & Individual Users** – Ideal for freelancers, small teams, and startups looking for a straightforward project management solution.

## **1. Who Are the Users?**

### **Primary Users:**

1. **Individual Users**:  

   - Users working on their own projects, using the app to manage personal tasks and goals.
2. **Team Members**:  

   - Users collaborating in teams or workgroups on various projects, including roles like project managers, team members, and contributors.
3. **Project Managers**:  

   - Users who are responsible for overseeing multiple projects, assigning tasks to team members, and ensuring the project runs smoothly.
4. **Collaborators/Stakeholders**:  

   - Users who are added to specific projects to either view progress or contribute to tasks (viewers, editors, or owners).

## **6. Post-MVP Features**

While the initial version (MVP) focuses on simplicity and core functionality, the following enhancements are planned for future iterations:

### Planned Features for Post-MVP Phase:

- **Task Dependencies** – Link tasks together (e.g., "Task B can’t start until Task A is complete").
- **Recurring Tasks** – Automate the creation of repetitive tasks.
- **File Attachments** – Allow users to upload files (e.g., specs, screenshots) to tasks.
- **Task Templates** – Predefined templates for commonly used task structures.
- **Bulk Actions** – Enable users to modify multiple tasks simultaneously.
- **Integrations** – Future support for Slack, Google Calendar, and email notifications.

> **Note:** The current design should account for these future enhancements to ensure smooth integration later.

## **7. Success Criteria**

### MVP Phase Goals (Adoption & Engagement)

#### Initial Adoption:

- Reach **1,000 users** within the first launch phase.

#### User Engagement:

- **60%+** of active users create at least one task per week.
- **50%+** of active users interact with task comments weekly.

#### Project Activity:

- **70%+** of created projects have at least one assigned task.
- **80%+** of tasks are updated at least once post-creation.

#### Retention:

- At least **50%** of new users return to use the app within a month of signup.

### Post-MVP Phase Goals

Once the product surpasses **1,000 users** and meets predefined engagement criteria, additional features and scaling strategies will be introduced to support a growing user base.

## **8. Non-Functional Requirements and Scalability Requirements**

1. **Performance**:

   - Task queries (e.g., querying tasks by tag or status) should complete in under 2 seconds for up to 10,000 tasks.
2. **Scalability**:

The MVP should support **hundreds of concurrent users** and **thousands of total users**. While detailed technical implementation is reserved for the development phase, key considerations include:

- **Efficient database indexing** to handle large task datasets.
- **Caching strategies** to improve load times for frequently accessed data.
- **Optimized API calls** to reduce server load and latency.
- **Pagination and lazy loading** for task-heavy projects.

> **Future scalability** for enterprise-grade workloads will be explored post-MVP.

3. **Security**:

   - User data must be encrypted at rest and in transit.
   - Only users with the appropriate roles should have access to modify tasks and project settings.

## 9. Performance Requirements

### MVP Performance Benchmarks:

#### Task Queries:

- Filtering and searching tasks should return results **within 2 seconds** (for up to **10,000 tasks**).

#### Page Load Time:

- The dashboard should load **within 3 seconds** for a standard project (~100 tasks).

#### Data Consistency & Syncing:

- Changes (e.g., task status updates) should reflect **within 1 second** across all active users.

#### Security & Reliability:

- User data must be **encrypted at rest and in transit**.
- The system should maintain **99.9% uptime** during the MVP phase.

## **10. Future Integrations (Post-MVP)**

While integrations are not part of MVP, the product roadmap includes:

- **Slack** – Task notifications and updates.
- **Google Calendar** – Sync task deadlines.
- **Email Notifications** – Improved email-based task alerts.

> These integrations will be prioritized based on user feedback and engagement data post-MVP.

## **Conclusion**

This PRD outlines the streamlined approach for the **Project and Task Management App**, focusing on ease of use, core collaboration features, and structured scalability. The initial goal is to validate **user adoption and engagement** before expanding into additional features and integrations in future phases.

The next step will be to **finalize feature prioritization** and proceed with **development planning** for the MVP launch.
