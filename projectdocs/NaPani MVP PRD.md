# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project and Task Management App

### Overview & Competitive Differentiation

The Project and Task Management App is a streamlined platform designed for individuals and teams to manage projects efficiently without feature overload. Unlike complex enterprise tools, this product focuses on simplicity, ease of use, and essential collaboration features. It enables users to track tasks, assign responsibilities, and monitor progress without requiring extensive setup or training.

#### Key Differentiators:

- **Minimalist UI & UX** – Ensures a frictionless experience for users to manage tasks and projects quickly.
- **No Feature Bloat** – Provides only essential task management functionalities to avoid overwhelming users.
- **Fast & Responsive** – Designed for speed and efficiency with lightweight interactions.
- **Scalable for Small Teams & Individual Users** – Ideal for freelancers, small teams, and startups looking for a straightforward project management solution.

## 2. Post-MVP Features

While the initial version (MVP) focuses on simplicity and core functionality, the following enhancements are planned for future iterations:

### Planned Features for Post-MVP Phase:

- **Task Dependencies** – Link tasks together (e.g., "Task B can’t start until Task A is complete").
- **Recurring Tasks** – Automate the creation of repetitive tasks.
- **File Attachments** – Allow users to upload files (e.g., specs, screenshots) to tasks.
- **Task Templates** – Predefined templates for commonly used task structures.
- **Bulk Actions** – Enable users to modify multiple tasks simultaneously.
- **Integrations** – Future support for Slack, Google Calendar, and email notifications.

> **Note:** The current design should account for these future enhancements to ensure smooth integration later.

## 3. Notifications Logic

### Types of Notifications:

- **Task Assignments** – User gets notified when assigned a task.
- **Task Status Changes** – Users following a task receive updates when the status changes.
- **New Comments** – Users assigned to or following a task get notified of new comments.
- **Project Member Additions** – Users receive a notification when added to a project.
- **Deadline Reminders** – Automatic alerts for upcoming task due dates.

### Delivery Methods:

- **In-App Notifications** – Real-time updates within the app.
- **Email Notifications** – Configurable email alerts for critical updates.
- **Push Notifications (Future Phase)** – Mobile notifications for instant updates.

### Notification Frequency & Rules:

- **Immediate** – Task assignments, mentions in comments.
- **Daily Digest** – Summary of pending tasks, upcoming deadlines.
- **Configurable Settings** – Users can enable/disable specific notifications.

## 4. Success Criteria

### MVP Phase Goals (Adoption & Engagement)

#### Initial Adoption:
- Reach **1,000 users** within the first launch phase.

#### User Engagement:
- **60%+** of active users create at least one task per week.
- **50%+** of active users interact with task comments weekly.

#### Project Activity:
- **70%+** of created projects have at least one assigned task.
- **80%+** of tasks are updated at least once post-creation.

#### Retention:
- At least **50%** of new users return to use the app within a month of signup.

### Post-MVP Phase Goals

Once the product surpasses **1,000 users** and meets predefined engagement criteria, additional features and scaling strategies will be introduced to support a growing user base.

## 5. Scalability Requirements

The MVP should support **hundreds of concurrent users** and **thousands of total users**. While detailed technical implementation is reserved for the development phase, key considerations include:

- **Efficient database indexing** to handle large task datasets.
- **Caching strategies** to improve load times for frequently accessed data.
- **Optimized API calls** to reduce server load and latency.
- **Pagination and lazy loading** for task-heavy projects.

> **Future scalability** for enterprise-grade workloads will be explored post-MVP.

## 6. Performance Requirements

### MVP Performance Benchmarks:

#### Task Queries:
- Filtering and searching tasks should return results **within 2 seconds** (for up to **10,000 tasks**).

#### Page Load Time:
- The dashboard should load **within 3 seconds** for a standard project (~100 tasks).

#### Data Consistency & Syncing:
- Changes (e.g., task status updates) should reflect **within 1 second** across all active users.

#### Security & Reliability:
- User data must be **encrypted at rest and in transit**.
- The system should maintain **99.9% uptime** during the MVP phase.

## 7. Future Integrations (Post-MVP)

While integrations are not part of MVP, the product roadmap includes:

- **Slack** – Task notifications and updates.
- **Google Calendar** – Sync task deadlines.
- **Email Notifications** – Improved email-based task alerts.

> These integrations will be prioritized based on user feedback and engagement data post-MVP.

## Conclusion

This PRD outlines the streamlined approach for the **Project and Task Management App**, focusing on ease of use, core collaboration features, and structured scalability. The initial goal is to validate **user adoption and engagement** before expanding into additional features and integrations in future phases.

The next step will be to **finalize feature prioritization** and proceed with **development planning** for the MVP launch.
